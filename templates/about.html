<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
<img src="/static/images/me.jpg" title="Yep, that's me!" style="float:left; margin-left:-30px; margin-top:-20px; margin-right:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
I am a scientist who loves biology and mathematics. As of late I also
got into computers and the Internet.</p>

<p>It all started when I first heard of Darwin and the Theory of Evolution.
I got fascinated by the idea that our parents, grand parents, and a whole
bunch of people that we will never meet survive a little bit in each
one of us, or at least in our DNA. From that moment I wanted to understand
the message etched by our ancestors in every single cell of our body,
and quite naturally ended up studying DNA.</p>

<p>Today I am the head of a research team at the CRG in Barcelona. Our main
focus is to understand how the regulatory genome is decoded by the cell,
or in other terms, how cells know what to do with their DNA.</p>

<p>I started this blog because I love writing and sharing knowlege.
I try to keep it diverse, in the limit of my own interests so my research
is only a small fraction of it.</p>

<h2>Post update and subscription</h2>
<p>You may have noticed the <strong>Subscribe...</strong> section in the
top left corner. You can click on the RSS or the email icon to be notified
of new posts, either in your favourite reader, or directly by email.
The atom feeds contain only an abstract of the post because the optional
sections and the mathematics formulas read very poorly in a reader or in
a mail.
</p>

<p>As of today, the feeds are powerd by
<a href="www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a>, which belongs to Google.
Unfortunately, Google does seem to be enthusiastic about the RSS technology
and they threaten to discontinue this service. If that happens, I will
provide other ways to keep you up-to-date. Besides, I always announce new
posts on <a href="https://twitter.com/thegrandlocus">Twitter</a>,
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/9ui11aume">Facebook</a> and
<a href="https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086/posts">Google+</a>.
</p>


<h2>About the blog</h2>
<p> For the sake of readability, I try to put the technical parts out of
the way. A message says when a blog post contains a technical section.
If you like challenges, or you want to go deeper, you can click on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle">Penrose
triangles</a> to show them.</p>

Whatever you think about The Grand Locus, or about a particular post,
I'd be happy to
<script type="text/javascript">print_mail('know it')</script>.
</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>
The design of The Grand Locus is the work of
Brit Pavelson. I asked her to do
something old-fashioned and never seen for a scientific website.
She mixed in her very strong personal style and came up with this.
First I found it too aggressive, but eventually I recognized the balance
and the simplicity of the graphics. I started developing the app with
a design in the line of her prototype and I am quite happy the way it
came out.
</p>

<p>
Behind the scene, The Grand Locus is a
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> app powered by
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a>. I put
the code of the blog on
<a href="https://github.com/gui11aume/thegrandlocus">Github</a>
where you can download or fork it. The code is itself a fork of
<a href="https://github.com/Arachnid/bloggart">Bloggart</a>,
an app written by <a href="http://blog.notdot.net">Nick Johson</a>. I
have never met you Nick, but if you ever read this, here is a big 
thank word for you. I probably learned more Python from you than from
anyone else, I owe you big time.
</p>

<p>
Google App Engine is a cloud service from Google. The nicest thing
about it is that you do not have to pay for it, but for some reason
it is a bit
<a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~silver/gae.html">buggy
and slow at times</a>. It even happens that the server
is down, which means that you might experience some slowness or
difficulties with connecting to The Grand Locus. For now problems
seem to be the exception more than the rule. Please
<script type="text/javascript">print_mail('let me know')</script>
if you experience recurrent problems.
</p>

<p>
For handling scientific content, I took a lot of inspiration from
<a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>, where I am
active mostly on
<a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com/">Cross-Validated</a>. The
occasional LaTeX math formulas are handled by
<a href="http://www.mathjax.org"/>mathjax</a> and the syntax highlighting
in the code uses
<a href="http://pygments.org">Pygments</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am also using the
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> interpreter
<a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/playground/showdown-highlight/">Showdown</a>,
<a href="http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/">qTip2</a> for context
bubbles, and of course <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
