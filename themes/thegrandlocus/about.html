<h2>About the blog</h2>

<p>
The design of The Grand Locus is the work of
<a href="http://britpavelson.com">Brit Pavelson</a>. I asked her to do
something old-fashioned and never seen for a scientific website.
She mixed in her very strong personal style and came up with this.
First I found it too aggressive, but eventually I recognized the balance
and the simplicity of the graphics. I started developing the app with
a design in the line of her prototype and I am quite happy the way it
came out.
</p>

<p>
Behind the scene, The Grand Locus is a
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> app powered by
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a>. I put
the code on <a href="https://github.com/gui11aume/thegrandlocus">Github</a>
where you can download or fork it. The code is itself a fork of
<a href="https://github.com/Arachnid/bloggart">Bloggart</a>,
an app written by <a href="http://blog.notdot.net">Nick Johson</a>. I
have never met you Nick, but if you ever read this, here is a big 
thank word for you. I probably learned more Python from you than from
anyone else, I owe you big time.
</p>

<p>
Google App Engine is a cloud service from Google. The nicest thing
about it is that you do not have to pay for it, but for some reason
it is a bit
<a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~silver/gae.html">buggy
and slow at times</a>. It even happens that the server
is down, which means that you might experience some slowness or
difficulties with connecting to The Grand Locus. For now problems
seem to be the exception more than the rule. Please
<script type="text/javascript">print_mail('let me know')</script>
if you experience recurrent problems with The Grand Locus.

Where is the FaceBook "I like" button? Well, it is just not there.
I don't like FaceBook. You still have the
<a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google +1</a> button if you want
to share The Grand Locus with your friends. Nick Johnson also wrote
support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feeds</a>,
which is geat if you use RSS readers.

<p>
For the sake of readability, I try to put the technical parts out of
the way. A message says when a blog post contains a technical section.
If you like challenges, or you want to go deeper, you can click on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle">Penrose
triangles</a> to show them.</p>

<p>
I hope you will enjoy reading The Grand Locus, and that my passion
for miscellaneous problems will be somewhat contagious. 
Whatever you think about The Grand Locus, or about a particular post,
I'd be happy to
